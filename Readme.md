### Get Missing People

Tiny script to check whether people inside the array (populate it with your stuff) are present in the zoom call.

### Notes:

- Works only in the web version of zoom
- Might get broken by dark mode extensions or if zoom team ever changes the styling, since relies on zoom's classname

### Contributions

- If you ever feel like this piece of poop provides you value and want to contribute - fork and PR at any time lol
